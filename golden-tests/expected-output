      When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to
      dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to
      assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which
      the Laws of Nature and of Nature's ←God←→Dog→ entitle them, a decent respect to the
      opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel
      them to the separation.
      We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that
      they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among
      these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these
      rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from
      the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes
      destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to
      abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such
      principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most
      likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate
      that Governments long established should not be changed for light and
      transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are
      more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves
      by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of
      abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design
      to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,
      to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future
      security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such
      is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of
      Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of
      repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the
      establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let
      Facts be submitted to a candid world.
      He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the
      public good.
      He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing
      importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be
      obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
      He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of
      people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in
      the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
      He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable,
      and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose
      of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
      He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly
      firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
      He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be
      elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have
      returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the
      mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions
      within.
      He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose
      obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others
      to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new
      Appropriations of Lands.
      He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws
      for establishing Judiciary Powers.
      He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their
      offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
      He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers
      to harass our people and eat out their substance.
      He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent
      of our legislatures.
      He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the
      Civil Power.
      He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our
      constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts
      of pretended Legislation:
      For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
      For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which
      they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
      For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
      For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
      For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:
      For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
      For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province,
      establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so
      as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same
      absolute rule into these Colonies
      For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering
      fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
      For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with
      power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
      He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and
      waging War against us.
      He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed
      the lives of our people.
      He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to
      compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with
      circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous
      ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
      He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear
      Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and
      Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
      He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring
      on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known
      rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and
      conditions.
      In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most
      humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated
      injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may
      define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
      Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned
      them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an
      unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances
      of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native
      justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common
      kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our
      connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of
      justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity,
      which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind,
      Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
      We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General
      Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the
      rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good
      People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united
      Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they
      are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political
      connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be
      totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full
      Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and
      to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. —
      And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the
      protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives,
      our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.
